*2025 (Now)*
- Back to training models. Transformers, ViTs, decoders - implemented from scratch.
- Conducting independent research on humanâ€“AI alignment and multi-modal transformers. 
- Building benchmarks for real-time memory, value, and preference alignment between users and AI agents.

*2024-2025*
- Core team at multiple stealth startups including a research/product lab focused on individual-to-agent alignment.
- Built a real-time voice agent to capture user values through live qualitative interviews.
- Helped run 1,000-agent multi-agent simulations grounded in real human data, memory and preferences. 

*2021-2024*
- Co-founded several startups, raising $8.5M+ in total.
- One helped send a human to space via Blue Origin.
- The others failed gloriously. Learned a lot.

*2021*
- Built an LSTM that beat clinical alarms in predicting medical emergencies.
- At Oxford's CHI Lab used NHS maternal health data and UPMC hopsital records to build time-series ML models for early risk detection.
- Graduated Oxford University with a BA/MEng in Information Engineering.
